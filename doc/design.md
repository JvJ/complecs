# Complecs #

Welcome to Complecs.  Complecs is a real-time experiment in the design and implementation of a domain-specific language for the creation of 2D games, written in Clojure.  It is based on the [Simplecs](https://github.com/s-k/simplecs) library, and is powered by libGDX.

Clojure, being a dialect of Lisp, is particularly well-suited to iterative and interactive design and development.  So here's my crazy idea: I'll design as I code as I write this document.

Let's get started.
